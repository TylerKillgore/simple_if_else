# simple_if_else
Console Application used to reinforce else-if syntax
1- Write a program and ask the user to enter a number. The number should be between 1 to 10. If the user enters a valid number, display "Valid" on the console. Otherwise, display "Invalid". (This logic is used a lot in applications where values entered into input boxes need to be validated.)
